Title: Flatmates Bill Split App
Project Description: An `app` that gets the `amount` of a `bill` for a particular `period`, the number of `days` each `flatmate` stayed in the `house` for that period as an inputs. 

Then, return how much each flatmate has to pay. It also generates a `PDF report` stating the `names` of the flatmates, the `period`, and how much each of them paid.
